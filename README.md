# MugenJi

My first fun Python project.
Personal Word Randomiser Game.

Ask user whether to add a word or randomise a word:
- [Q] to quit
- [C] to clear
- [O] to open list in notepad
- [P] to view list in terminal
- ["Any word"] to add to list
- [""] to randomise a word

To build package:
pyinstaller gui.py --onefile --name MugenJi -w
